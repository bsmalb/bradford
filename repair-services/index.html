<h2 id="clean-oil-and-adjust-coa---service-description">Clean, Oil, and Adjust (COA) - Service Description</h2>
<p>This is the service you need if your flute just doesn’t quite seem to be playing as well as it used to. For flutes that are played a lot this is typically an annual service. COA service is for flutes that have been well maintained. If a flute has been damaged or has not been serviced for many years, then more work will be required to bring that flute back to optimal performance.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean</strong> - The keys, body, and mechanism of the flute are all cleaned. The mechanism is completely disassembled, including unpinning any pinned sections, so that old oil may be cleaned out. The tone holes and bore of the flute are also cleaned, as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Oil</strong> - After cleaning, the mechanism is given fresh oil and reassembled. This makes the flute more quiet and smooth in its key action.
For wooden flutes only: the body of the flute is oiled, inside and out (with the appropriate oil–different from key oil). This oil must be then thoroughly wiped off and the flute allowed to sit for a couple days. The tone holes are then carefully cleaned of any residue of oil before the keys are put back on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjust</strong> - Although as a repair person I strive for utmost stability, slight changes in the padding and adjustments of a flute add up over time, making the flute less resonant and more “fuzzy” sounding. Every pad, adjustment, and tail on the flute is checked over and adjusted as needed. This is generally the most labor-intensive portion of a COA service. Often no pads need to be replaced during a COA service, but it is not uncommon that a pad or two must be replaced. If many or most pads need replacing, then this flute probably requires a repad or overhaul service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-often-is-a-coa-service-needed">How often is a COA service needed?</h3>
<p>For a flute that is played regularly a COA is typically a yearly service. However, a flute that is very stable may go longer between COA services, while a less stable flute may need attention more frequently. If you are starting to notice minor playing issues and wonder, “is it me, or is it the flute?” then it is probably time for a COA.</p>
<h2 id="repad-and-overhaul-services">Repad and Overhaul services</h2>
<p>A repad is indicated when a flute needs a completely new set of pads. The replacement of pads naturally requires the replacement of the adjustment materials and tails. Any damage or mechanical issues must be dealt with before repadding. If a flute needs significant mechanical restoration before repadding can begin, the service is considered an overhaul. Basically, an overhaul includes a repad, plus extra work at the beginning. The beginning of an overhaul is an ideal time to address cosmetic issues as well, such as dents or tarnish. (Please be aware that full tarnish clean-up on a flute that is completely tarnished is very time consuming and costly.)</p>
<h3 id="how-often-is-a-repad-or-overhaul-service-needed">How often is a repad or overhaul service needed?</h3>
<p>Flute pads inevitably wear out. I estimate about ten years for pad life-span, but pads can last shorter or longer based on a number of factors. Certain pads on the flute tend to wear more quickly than others, so if a flute has had pads replaced during regular COA services, it is possible that the flute won’t require a full repad (assuming the tail materials hold up well over time). Effectively, the pads are replaced as needed rather than all at once. However, if half or more of the pads on a flute are ripped, or if the pads are very old, then it makes sense to do a complete repad. An overhaul is only needed if the flute requires significant mechanical work before repadding (usually caused by damage, poor prior repair work, or poor work in the original making of the instrument. In the case of vintage flutes, the need for an overhaul can also be material failure or accumulated wear over time.)</p>
<h3 id="makes-and-models-serviced">Makes and Models Serviced</h3>
<p>I have personal experience in repairing handmade flutes and piccolos from nearly every contemporary maker. I do not service beginner-level instruments, but I strive to offer friendly guidance to flutists in need. Please contact me for availability and repair scheduling.</p>
<h3 id="other-types-of-flutes">Other Types of Flutes</h3>
<p>I can service piccolos as well as alto and bass flutes. I also service simple-system (Irish) flutes and one-key flutes (Baroque and Classical). I have also serviced and restored many types of antique flutes as well. My work is strictly focused on flutes&ndash;I do not work on any other types of instruments.</p>
<h1 id="typical-pricing---january-2025">Typical Pricing - January 2025</h1>
<p>Services vary in cost depending on the amount of time and labor required.</p>
<p><strong>COA</strong>: $350 - $700 ($400 - $500 is typical)</p>
<p><strong>Repad</strong>: $1,800 - $2,300</p>
<p><strong>Overhaul</strong>: $2,300 - $2,700</p>
<p><strong>Hourly rate</strong>: $125 per hour</p>
<h3 id="estimates">Estimates</h3>
<p>After I have received your instrument and inspected it I will provide a more specific estimate of the repair cost. If I discover anything additional during service that would cause the cost to exceed this estimate, I will contact you for your approval before proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="warranty">Warranty</h3>
<p>It is my goal is that your flute should reliably play its best every time you pick it up. If your flute should go out of adjustment shortly after service, or if you are unsatisfied with my work, I will address and fix the problem at no additional cost to you (other than cost of shipping, if necessary).</p>
<p>COA repairs are guaranteed for 90 days following service. Repad and overhaul services are guaranteed for six months following service. Only the work that was recently performed by me is covered under warranty. Problems or damage not related to my work cannot be covered under warranty.</p>
<h3 id="shipping">Shipping</h3>
<p>Please communicate with me to confirm availability before shipping.</p>
<h3 id="insurance">Insurance</h3>
<p>Please check with your insurer to confirm that your instrument will be insured during shipment.</p>
<h3 id="shipping-service">Shipping service</h3>
<p>You may ship to us using any shipping carrier. Shipments are secured in the mailroom at delivery so signature confirmation is not needed. I  typically use USPS for outgoing shipment within the United States and FedEx for international shipments. By default, I use signature confirmation with outgoing shipments. Please let me know if you have any preferences or special requirements with regard to shipping.</p>
<h3 id="scheduling-accommodations">Scheduling Accommodations</h3>
<p>I strive to accommodate your scheduling needs, but I also insist on taking the time required to complete all jobs to the highest standard and ensure stability. If you need your flute back by a certain date or you have a specific time you’d like to receive your flute back, please communicate this in advance (as part of your initial scheduling email with me). Although I cannot guarantee a specific completion date for service, I will do our best to accommodate your needs.</p>
<p>Certain times of year are particularly busy, particularly December through early January. It&rsquo;s always best to schedule your repair well in advance whenever possible.</p>
